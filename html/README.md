Milestone Project 1 - The Bittersweet Music Website


The aim of this project was to build a music website for ‘The Bittersweet’, an electro-pop act that I am part of.

I took a lot of inspiration and meaning from Seth Godin’s book ‘This Is Marketing’ and in particular this quote -

“Twenty-dollar bills are meaningless.  It’s what you can buy with them that we work for.
The same is true of your product or service.  You may say you’re offering a widget, but don’t believe it.  When you’re marketing change, you’re offering a new emotional state, a step closer to the dreams and desires of your customers, not a widget.
We sell feelings, status, and connection, not tasks or stuff”.

So the hope was to create an online space that reflected the band’s music and artistic style but also to provide value to the user in terms of both information and user experience.

The provisional launch date for the website is May1st 2020 so a few more features and content will be added before that date.

Demo

UX

The website is for fans of the band or new users to find out more,

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:


As a user I want to see all available dates to see the band live.


As a user I want to buy some of the band’s music.


As a user I want to connect with the band’s social media sites


As a user I want to keep up to date with the band’s news and updates.



As a user I want to watch the band’s latest video release



Wireframes


The Strategy Plane:
Business Goals 2020 - brand awareness, showcase band’s music.
User Needs.  Access to content and information in a well presented manner I.e. don’t overload with content.

The Scope Plane:
The Minimum Viable Product is an online space that lays out the band’s vision and points the user to relevant information.

The Structure Plane:
The information is structured in a clean and clear way.
The homepage being saved for just a photo and whatever the main feature will be the ‘call to action’ for the band, whatever that may be at any given time.
The rest of the information will be divided between the About, Video, Tour and Store pages, which are all self-explanatory and easy to follow.

The Surface Plane:
The site will have a minimalist feel.  Use of greys and retro simple fonts is used to reflect the art-style of Shoreditch, where the band is currently based.
Simple old-school drawings of swallows and subtle nature photography reflects the Irish roots of the band.
The sparse use of red was used to give a feeling of energy/excitement which is a reflection of the bands electronic musical influences.

All these seemingly small design decisions hopefully combine to achieve an artistic experience for the user and gives a feel for what the project is about.






Features
In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.

Existing Features

Spotify player
* ...
For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.
In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

Features Left to Implement
* A functioning Newsletter/Email Database.  
* A functioning store to sell merchandise, vinyl’s etc.

When I learn the required technologies I will implement these features.

Technologies Used

    1. HTML5
    2. CSS3
    3. Bootstrap4
    4. HTML Formatter https://htmlformatter.com/    (A simple way to beautify HTML)
    5. CSS Formatter https://www.cleancss.com/css-beautify/  (A convenient way to beautify CSS)
    6. Can I Use?  https://caniuse.com/    (This site let gave info on whether vendor prefixes were required for the features I had implemented)


Testing
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:
1. Contact form:
    * Go to the "Contact Us" page
    * Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    * Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    * Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.
You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.
If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).
In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
* Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
* Different configuration files?
* Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
